# Kalman Filter Color Detector

The Kalman Filter Color Detector is a Python application that utilizes the Kalman filter algorithm to detect and track objects of a specific color in images or videos. It provides accurate position estimation of the detected object by combining color detection and Kalman filtering techniques.

## Features

- Object color detection using HSV color space.
- Object position tracking using the Kalman filter algorithm.
- Support for processing individual images or video files.
- Results stored in a JSON file for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thealonemusk/kalaman_filtre

2. Install requirements
3. Run the code pref(google collabs)
